<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website!</p>

<p>I'm Shams Kazim Abbas also known as Ali Zayf, currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. As I'm still at the learning stage of my journey, I'm constantly exploring new technologies, building my skills, and deepening my understanding of AI and its real-world applications.</p>

<p>My academic path has introduced me to exciting areas like machine learning, data analysis, and software development, and I'm eager to apply this knowledge in meaningful ways. I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I'm committed to growing both professionally and personally through each challenge and opportunity I encounter.</p>

<p>This website serves as a platform where I share my projects, experiences, and the knowledge I gain along the way. It's also a space to connect with others who share my passion for AI and technology.</p>
